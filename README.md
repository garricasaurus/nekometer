# What is Nekometer?

**Nekometer** is an alternative, minimalist damage meter addon. I have originally developed this addon for personal use as a hobby project. After using it for a while, I have decided to share it in case someone else finds it useful.

Why did I develop my own damage meter addon instead of using an existing popular addon from the list of available ones?

There are several reasons:

   * I wanted to develop an addon for fun and personal enjoyment
   * I've found the existing similar addons too bloated for my taste
   * I like to use the default WoW UI with as little modifications as possible, but I still wanted to have a basic idea of my character's throughput
   

# Addon philosophy

When developing the addon, the following were taken into consideration:

   * small feature set
   * clean, simple, non-intrusive interface
   * simple settings, with sensible defaults
   * small, readable, open code base
   * should have a minimal impact on system resources

I've decided **not to add** some features to keep the addon minimal:

   * logging/reporting to file, chat, sharing the data
   * fancy graphics, charts
   * complex configuration options, startup wizards
   * multiple windows

A lot of features other similar addons support are missing, often intentionally. It is important to remember, that it is not the goal for this addon to compete with those addons, but to provide a minimalist alternative for those who do not want to use them for any reason.
